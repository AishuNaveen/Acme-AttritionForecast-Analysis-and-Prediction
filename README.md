## Project Overview

Employee attrition is a significant concern for many organizations as it impacts productivity, morale, and costs. This project aims to analyze historical employee data to identify key factors influencing attrition and to build predictive models that can help forecast future attrition rates.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various features such as employee demographics, job roles, compensation, performance, and other relevant attributes. It provides a comprehensive view of the factors that may contribute to employee turnover.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Technocolabs100/Acme-AttritionForecast-Analysis-and-Prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Acme-AttritionForecast-Analysis-and-Prediction
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

The project can be run using the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts. Follow the steps below:

1. Explore the data using `01_data_exploration.ipynb`.
2. Preprocess the data with `02_data_preprocessing.ipynb`.
3. Perform feature engineering using `03_feature_engineering.ipynb`.
4. Build and train predictive models in `04_modeling.ipynb`.
5. Evaluate the models with `05_evaluation.ipynb`.

Alternatively, you can run the entire workflow using the Python scripts in the `src/` directory.

## Results

The results of the analysis and predictions, including key insights, model performance metrics, and visualizations, will be stored in the `results/` directory.
